          Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. Make sure to follow CDC guidelines for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
          </li>
          <li>
            Self isolate for 10 full days after symptoms first appeared (or starting the day after you had your test, if you have no symptoms).
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are self isolating at home where others live, use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible). Clean any shared rooms as needed, to avoid transmitting the virus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
          </li>
          <li>
            If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have a supply of clean, disposable face masks. Everyone, no matter their COVID-19 diagnosis, should wear face masks while in the home.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Watch for symptoms and

            learn when to seek emergency medical attention
          </a>
          . If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Trouble breathing
          </li>

            Persistent chest pain/pressure
          </li>
          <li>
            Confusion

          <li>
            Inability to wake or stay awake
          </li>
          <li>
            Bluish lips or face
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency room: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.

        <p>
          An inconclusive result is neither positive nor negative. This can happen because of problems with the sample collection, a very early-stage COVID-19 infection, or for patients with COVID-19 that are close to recovery. With an inconclusive result, collecting and testing another sample is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please make an appointment for another test as soon as possible. If you’ve gotten tested due to COVID-19 symptoms, it is recommended that you self-isolate until you get your new test results.

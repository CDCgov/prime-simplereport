        As a User accessing or using SimpleReport (Application) provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in a CDC cloud environment (“CDC Platform”), you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for and shall abide by these Terms of Service, as well as any relevant sections of

      </h2>
      <p>
        SimpleReport is a free tool that makes it easy for facilities such as health care settings or schools to record and quickly transmit public health data to public health departments. It also allows those facilities to enable individuals or guardians to access relevant test results. This Application is being provided by HHS and CDC to enable an Entity to record its data intake workflow, for record keeping needs and to transmit relevant and necessary data to state, local, tribal, and territorial public health authorities (STLT Public Health Agencies) in furtherance of public health surveillance and response activities. It also allows the Entity to designate certain users of the data, as set out in these Terms. The Application through which the Entity and any users interact with relevant public health data is subject to these Terms. Use of the Application constitutes acceptance of these Terms.

      <p>
        An individual whose personal data is being reported via Simple Report (Individual User), or an individual authorized to act on behalf of the Entity under these Terms (Entity User or Entity Administrator). Simple Report will only designate one User from the Entity as the Entity Administrator. Entity Administrators will have more detailed identity verification than general Entity Users. Once the Entity Administrator has their identity verified, the Entity Administrator can add other general Entity Users or Individual Users to the Application. All roles are referred to as “User” for the purposes of these Terms, unless otherwise indicated.

        If you are using the Application on behalf of an Entity as either an Entity Administrator or Entity User, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that Entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that Entity (and all references to “you” in the Terms refer to you and that Entity).

        In order to access the Application, as part of the registration process for the Application, and for your continued use of the Application, you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details).

         so that we can keep you informed of any changes to the Application or these Terms which may impact your usage of the Application. We may use the contact information you provide to contact you regarding usability research for ongoing product and service improvement. Upon Entity registration and the creation of Entity User accounts within the Application, credentials (such as passwords, keys, tokens, and Entity and Entity User identifications (IDs)) will be issued to you by HHS or CDC. These credentials are intended to be used only by you and to identify any software or APIs which you are using. You agree to keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other persons from using your credentials.

As such, CDC does not intend to take custody or control of data sent via the Application. Entity and Individual Users acknowledge and agree that CDC and Administrative Users may manage the data sent via the Application for purposes of operating the CDC Platform (which includes verifying user identity) and transmitting to and facilitating use by STLT Public Health Agencies of such data.

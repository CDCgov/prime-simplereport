      <p>
        SimpleReport is a free tool that makes it easy for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing sites to record results for rapid point-of-care tests and quickly report required data to public health departments. This Application is being provided by HHS and CDC to enable a Facility to record its testing workflow, for record keeping needs and to route relevant and necessary testing data to state, local, tribal, and territorial public health authorities (STLT Public Health Agencies) in furtherance of public health response activities related to COVID-19. It also allows Facility to designate certain users of the data, as set out in these Terms. The Application through which you interact with relevant public health data is subject to these Terms. Use of the Application constitutes acceptance of these Terms.

      <p>
        If you are using the Application on behalf of a Facility, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that Facility to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that Facility (and all references to "you" in the Terms refer to you and that Facility). In order to access the Application, as part of the registration process for the Application, and for your continued use of the Application, you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details). Any such information you give to CDC or HHS must be accurate and up-to-date, and you must inform us promptly of any updates so that we can keep you informed of any changes to the Application or these Terms which may impact your usage of the Application. Upon Facility registration and the creation of Facility User accounts within the Application, credentials (such as passwords, keys, tokens, and Facility and Facility User identifications (IDs)) will be issued to you by HHS or CDC. These credentials are intended to be used only by you and to identify any software or APIs which you are using. You agree to keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other persons from using your credentials.

        Upon a Facility's registration (and on an ongoing basis, as needed), the Facility must designate at least one user from the Facility as the Administrator. This Administrator will have more detailed identity verification. Once the Administrator has their identity verified, the Administrator can add other Facility Users to the Application. The Administrator agrees to verify identity on Facility Users who are added and to inactivate Facility Users who should no longer have access. The Administrator also agree to set permissions appropriately to determine the minimum access necessary for Facility Users to complete their required job duties.

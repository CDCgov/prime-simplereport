      For COVID-19:
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people who get COVID-19 are able to recover at home. Make sure to follow CDC guidelines and local laws for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stay home for 5 days. If you have no symptoms or your symptoms are resolving after 5 days, you can leave your house. Continue to wear a mask around others for 5 additional days.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are self isolating at home where others live, use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible). Clean any shared rooms as needed, to avoid transmitting the virus.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
      </li>
      <li>
        If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have a supply of clean, disposable face masks. Everyone, no matter their COVID-19 diagnosis, should wear face masks while in the home.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Watch for symptoms and learn when to seek emergency medical attention:

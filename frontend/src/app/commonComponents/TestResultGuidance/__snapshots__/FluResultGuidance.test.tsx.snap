  <p>
    Most people with flu have mild illness and can recover at home. Stay at home and avoid contact with others until at least 24 hours after your fever is gone, except to get medical care or other necessities. Wear a face mask if you leave home, or cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Wash your hands often.

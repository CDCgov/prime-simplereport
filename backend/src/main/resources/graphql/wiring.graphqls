# If applied to a field, the requester must meet the required permission level in order to request
# or traverse the targeted field. If the requirement is not met, `null` will be supplied for the
# targeted field and an error returned.
#
# If applied to an object, the request must meet the required permission level in order to request
# any fields of the object. If any child fields are themselves targeted with this directive, the
# requester must satisfy both object- and field-level directives to request or traverse said fields.
#
# If applied to an argument, the requester must meet the required permission level in order to
# supply a non-default value for the targeted argument; otherwise, an error will be returned and the
# query or mutation housing the argument will not be executed.

# automatically by graphql-java-extended-validation once they are defined in this file.
# Cf. https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java-extended-validation for a complete list of
# directives that can be used.

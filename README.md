## Setup

1. Install Docker and docker-compose
   - You can install docker hub directly: https://hub.docker.com/. This is the preferred solution and should come with docker-compose
   - Alternatively, you can install docker and run it as a daemon: `brew install docker docker-compose`.

## Backend

There are two major pieces:

- a Java Spring Boot application
- a postgresql database

To run the service, you need a JDK and some way of running postgresql (most
people choose to use Docker, but you can also just run it as a service on your
development box.) To test the full authentication/authorization/user-management
integration, you will also need Okta credentials, but that is not necessary
most of the time.

### Backend-Setup

If Java isn't installed on a Mac you can get it from `brew`:

```sh
brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk
brew install --cask adoptopenjdk11
brew install gradle
```

Another option (also compatible with Linux) is to install with [jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba), the Java version manager:

```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/shyiko/jabba/raw/master/install.sh | bash && . ~/.jabba/jabba.sh
jabba install adopt@1.11-0
jabba use adopt@1.11
```

Running with docker:

1. `cd backend`
1. Run `docker-compose up --build`
1. view site at http://localhost:8080

Running spring app locally and db in docker

1. `cd backend`
1. Run `docker-compose up -d db`
1. Run `./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev'`
1. view site at http://localhost:8080

Running spring app locally and db in docker on port 5433

1. `cd backend`
1. Run `docker-compose --env-file .env.development up db`
1. Run `SR_DB_PORT=5433 ./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev'`
1. view site at http://localhost:8080

The GraphQL playground should load after replacing the default request url with
`http://localhost:8080/graphql`

### Running the app with Make or start.sh

For development, it may be more convenient to start the front and backends simultaneously. This can be done by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
make # "make start" if you're nasty
```

This will start up both servers in "watch" mode, so that changes to the source
code result in an immediate rebuild.

If you'd like to use a local installation of PostgreSQL, run the following to create a local database:

```bash
# Run this to create or reset the local db. Assumes your $USER has superuser privileges.
# If not, use POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=$USER LIB_DIR="$(pwd)/backend/db-setup" POSTGRES_DB=postgres ./backend/db-setup/create-db.sh
```

Then run this to start the app:

```bash
./start.sh
```

This will also start up both servers in "watch" mode. When using `start.sh`, any environment variables put
in `.env` in the root directory will be available to the app. Press CTRL-C to exit and cleanup the servers cleanly.

### Running locally with Okta

You can run the app against the "Okta Preview" instance by running the backend with the `okta-local` Spring profile. Be sure to set the `OKTA_API_KEY` environment variable. You can generate an API token for yourself by logging into the Okta Preview [admin panel](https://hhs-prime-admin.oktapreview.com) and going into Security > API > Tokens.

You also need to set the following in `frontend/.env.local`:

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_OKTA_ENABLED=true
```

### Updating user role

By default the local test user is an organization admin role. If you need to change this value to test out other permissions.
It can be set in `application-local.yaml`. If you have not created one run:

bash

```
touch backend/src/main/resources/application-local.yaml
```

#### Organization roles

Organization roles can be set by adding the following to `application-local.yaml`:

```
simple-report:
  demo-users:
    default-user:
      authorization:
        granted-roles: ADMIN
```

current role types are `ADMIN`, `USER`, `ENTRY_ONLY`, `ALL_FACILITIES`, and `NO_ACCESS`. You can check `backend/src/main/java/gov/cdc/usds/simplereport/config/authorization/OrganizationRole.java` for a list of available roles

`ADMIN` - an organization admin with full access to their organization
`USER` - a site user the has access to everything in their organization but the gear icon
`ENTRY_ONLY` - a site user that only has access to the Conduct Test tab
`ALL_FACILITIES` - a site user that can access all facilities in their organization
`NO_ACCESS` - a member of an organization who has no permissions without possessing other roles

#### Site roles

You can make the default user a site admin by adding the following to `application-local.yaml`:

```
simple-report:
  demo-users:
    site-admin-emails:
      - bob@example.com
```

Site admins can access the `/admin` paths and site admin APIs

### Restart & Clean

When there are DB schema changes the backend may throw an error and fail to start.

Restarting the docker way:

1. run `cd backend`
1. Bring down the service by running `docker-compose down`
1. Wipe the db by running `docker system prune && docker images prune && docker volume prune`
1. Restart the service `docker-compose up --build`

Restarting the SQL way:

1. run `db-setup/nuke-db.sh`
2. restart the spring app `gradle bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev'`

### Rollbacks

The application uses the Liquibase plugin for Gradle to perform certain database management tasks.

To roll the database back to its state at a prior date:

```
$ ./gradlew liquibaseRollbackToDate -PliquibaseCommandValue=${date}
```

To roll back a certain _number_ of migrations:

```
$ ./gradlew liquibaseRollbackCount -PliquibaseCommandValue=${n}
```

To roll back to a certain tag:

```
$ ./gradlew liquibaseUpdateToTag -PliquibaseCommandValue=${TAG}
```

If you are required to roll back a non-local database, you may generate the required SQL to execute elsewhere. Use `liquibaseRollbackToDateSQL` or `liquibaseRollbackCountSQL` in the manner described above to write the rollback SQL to stdout.

### API Testing

Go to `localhost:8080` to see interact with the graphql api. You would need to point the api endpoint to the backend at: `http://localhost:8080/graphql` This gives you a preview to query/mutate the local database.

### Tests

All the tests can be run with `gradle test`. Make sure that you do not have `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` set in your shell environment.

Running a single test with a full stacktrace can be accomplished by supping the path to `gradle test`. Example

```bash
gradle test --tests gov.cdc.usds.simplereport.api.QueueManagementTest.updateItemInQueue --stacktrace
```

### Local Settings

To edit Spring Boot settings for your local set up you must first create a `application-local.yaml`
(note this file is git ignored):

bash

```
touch backend/src/main/resources/application-local.yaml
```

Useful local settings

- make the default user an admin

```
simple-report:
  demo-users:
    site-admin-emails:
      - bob@example.com
```

- make SQL pretty

```
spring:
  jpa:
    properties:
      hibernate:
        format_sql: true
```

- set CORS allowed-origins (this can be useful for testing the Okta integration)

```
simple-report:
  cors:
    allowed-origins:
      - http://localhost:3000
```

To edit React settings, create `frontend/.env.local` (also git ignored).

### E2E Tests

E2E/Integration tests are available using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

#### Requirements:

These files required to run integration tests.
- `frontend/.env.local`
- `frontend/cypress/.env.e2e`
- `/etc/hosts`

```
# frontend/cypress/.env.e2e
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost.simplereport.gov
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost.simplereport.gov/api
REACT_APP_OKTA_ENABLED=true
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL=http://localhost:8088
```

The `frontend/.env.local` file has a template at `frontend/cypress/.env.e2e.sample`. Reach out to another developer to get proper values for these secrets.

```
# /etc/hosts
# add the following line
127.0.0.1 localhost.simplereport.gov
```

#### Running Cypress
Now that you have those files set up, you are ready for a test run! There are a few ways to run the tests from the `frontend` directory:

- `yarn e2e`
  - This will run cypress with default values and display Cypress logs.
- `yarn e2e:open`
  - This will open an interactive test runner that lets you select browsers
  - Additional requirement: To use this command you need to set the WIREMOCK_URL env var in your command line.
    - Set this for macOS
        - `WIREMOCK_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8088`
    - Set this for Linux operating systems (if you have a non standard networking setup, set it to whatever IP will point to your local machine).
        - `WIREMOCK_URL=http://172.17.0.1:8088`
- `yarn e2e:verbose`
  - This will run cypress with default values and display Cypress, API, DB, Frontend, and Nginx logs.

See the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/table-of-contents) for writing new tests. If you need to generate new Wiremock mappings for external services, see [this wiki page](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-simplereport/wiki/WireMock).

#### Notes
Make sure docker has access to enough resources on your local machine. You'll know it doesn't if you get an error from any of your containers similar to this:
```
"The build failed because the process exited too early. This probably means the system ran out of memory or someone called `kill -9` on the process."
```

How to update resources limits on your [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/#resources), and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/#resources) machines.

### SchemaSpy

http://schemaspy.org/

```bash
cd backend
docker-compose up db
docker-compose up --build schemaspy
# to run on a different port than 8081
SR_SCHEMASPY_PORT=8082 docker-compose up --build schemaspy
```

visit http://localhost:8081

### Twilio

Twilio's Java SDK auto-configures based on two environment variables: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`. SMS is also disabled by default, and can be enabled in application.yml:

```
twilio:
  enabled: true
  from-number: +13214560987
```

These can also be set by environment variable if desired.

### MailHog

MailHog is an email-testing tool with a fake SMTP server underneath, we can use it to test sending emails locally.

- Mailhog client runs on docker, `docker-compose up -d mailhog`
- add the following to `application-local.yaml` to configure the backend to send email to mailhog client

```yml
spring:
  mail:
    host: localhost
    port: 1025
```

- Access mailhog inbox on `http://localhost:8025/`

## Frontend

The front end is a React app. The app uses [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) to manage the graphql API. For styling the app leverages the [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/). Ensure your node version is version 14 in order for
yarn to build packages correctly.

### Frontend-Setup

1. (optional) Install react developer tools extensions
1. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
1. `cd frontend && yarn install && docker-compose up`
1. view site at http://localhost:3000
   - Note: frontend need the backend to be running to work

### Linters

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/), [prettier](https://prettier.io/), and [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) as frontend linters,
and [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) and [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) for the backend.
GitHub Actions is configured to run these linters on every pull request, so you must resolve all mismatches/errors prior to merging.
There are a few ways to manage this:

1. Run `yarn lint:write` in the `frontend/` dir, and `./gradlew spotlessApply` in the `backend/` dir, before every commit
1. Enable the optional pre-commit hook by running `yarn install` in the root dir
1. Add extensions to your code editor that runs the linters for you on save, e.g. [prettier-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), [vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), [vscode-google-java-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ilkka.google-java-format)

### Storybook and Chromatic

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React. It makes building UIs organized and efficient.

To view the Storybook locally:

- Run `yarn storybook` in the `frontend/` dir
- Visit http://localhost:6006

[Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) is a web-based tool for Storybook that helps speed UI
component development. It provides regression testing and review. It also allows for publication
of the Storybook.

Changes to the Storybook are sent to Chromatic when changes to the frontend source are push to a
any branch. The changes are automatically accepted on merge to `main`.

View the [SimpleReport Storybook](https://main--60a556a7c807cc0039ec6786.chromatic.com/)

## PR Conventions

The convention for branch naming on this project is {firstName}/{ticketNumber}-{short-description}. This makes it easier for other developers to find your changes.

If you're merging large or complex changes, it is strongly recommended that you smoke test them in `dev`, `test`, or `pentest`. These three environments are roughly the same, with small configuration changes between each (`test` sends text results for pxp while `dev` and `pentest` do not, for example.)

For all changes, please ensure the PR checklist is completed before sending out for review. If you're making UI changes, make sure to screenshot and get approval from a designer or product manager, in addition to engineers.

We require two reviewers per changeset, and you cannot merge until all commits have been reviewed.

## Deploy

SimpleReport uses a continuous deployment deployment (CD) process
![deployment-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53869143/130135128-e4cf1b7a-2903-4f20-bd3f-a98daea15fd1.png)

### Revert to a Previous Release

**Note:** A bad version can be rolled backed independent of the FE via the [rollback API actions](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-simplereport/actions/workflows/rollbackProdAPI.yml)

1. checkout `main`
2. create a new branch (example: `tim-best/revert-feature-A`)
3. Revert to the desired commit `git revert --no-commit 9999999..HEAD && git commit` where 9999999 is the commit you want to revert to
   - This will revert everything from the HEAD back to the commit hash, meaning it will recreate that commit state in the working tree as if every commit after 9999999 had been walked back
4. Create a PR with your branch, wait for tests to pass, get approval and merge
5. Follow instructions in [deploy-with-release](#deploy-with-release)

### Deploy With Action

Navigate to the [Github Actions Tab](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-simplereport/actions)
![Screen Shot 2021-02-24 at 11 07 13 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53869143/109029807-36673100-7691-11eb-81d1-a474517c1eb6.png)

1. Select the environment you want to deploy to from the workflows list on the left. In this case we are selecting the `test` environment
2. Click the "Run workflow" button
3. Select the branch you want to deploy. In this case we are deploying the latest commit on `main`
4. Click the green "Run workflow" button.
5. After the workflow is completed you can verify the changes are live by Checking the deployed commit hash. This is done my going to `/app/static/commit.txt` and `/api/actuator/info`

## Deployment Issues

### Maintenance Mode

Users can be notified of deployment issues by placing SimpleReport in maintenance mode. When maintenance mode is enabled, a banner will appear at the top of each page stating that SimpleReport is currently experiencing an outage, along with a configurable supplemental message (e.g. a reason why).

To do so manually:

1. Create a `MAINTENANCE MESSAGE` in JSON format with an `active` and a `message` key. Example: `{"active": true, "message": "SimpleReport is currently undergoing maintenance"}`. Note that the `active` value must be a _boolean_, not a string.
2. `cd frontend && MAINTENANCE_MESSAGE=(JSON message here) MAINTENANCE_ENV=(desired env) yarn run maintenance:start`

Example:

```Shell
MAINTENANCE_MESSAGE='{"active": true, "header" : "SimpleReport is currently experiencing an outage.", "message": "SimpleReport is currently experiencing service degradation"}' MAINTENANCE_ENV=dev yarn run maintenance:start
```

Possible values for `MAINTENANCE_ENV`: `dev`, `test`, `pentest`, `training`, `demo`, `stg`, `prod`

An easier way is to run the `Maintenance Mode` Action, which will automatically enable/disable maintenance mode for all environments with your desired message.

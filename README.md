## Overview
SimpleReport, as part of PRIME (Pandemic-Ready Interoperability Modernization Effort), aims to improve data quality, completeness and timeliness of public health case reporting for COVID-19, the flu and future infectious diseases.

SimpleReport does this by creating a real-time avenue for providers who do not have traditional healthcare IT systems to send high quality, timely, structured data to public health. This ensures that public health has a clear(er) and more timely, complete picture of COVID positivity and can take appropriate steps to intervene and prevent further community spread.

## Getting Started

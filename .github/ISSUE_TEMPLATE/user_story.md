## User Story

As a [user/persona], I want to [do a thing], so that I can [achieve a goal/outcome]

## Acceptance Criteria

_list out all expected functionality/requirements_

-

## Scenarios

_Write out scenarios that will help to ensure the functionality works as expected_

For example, this could look like:

- I click on the Score filter and a dropdown appears showing a slider.
- “1” and “10” are selected by default. The submit button is disabled.
- I then drag the left slider to “6” making the score 6 to 10.
- The text input below updates to display “6” and submit button is now active.
- I click submit and the dropdown closes.
- My search results are now updated.
